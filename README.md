# Trevor Jarvis Portfolio Site

I started this site from a blank template using create-react-app. The code behind the site consists of React and Sass, with a few external dependencies installed through npm for some of the animations that you see. I created the rest of the animations using CSS3 transitions and keyframes.

The site was designed to be responsive and mobile-first. This was done through utilizing lots of media queries in the Sass as well as Grid and Flex layouts.

This site is hosted using Firebase Hosting, which I find to be user-friendly and cost-effective.

Feel free to clone this site and use it for your own needs!
